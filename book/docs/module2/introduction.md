# Module 2: Introduction to The Digital Twin

## The Digital Twin Concept

The Digital Twin represents a virtual replica of a physical robot system. It enables:
- **Testing without hardware**: Develop and test robot behaviors safely
- **Rapid iteration**: Experiment with different configurations quickly
- **Cost reduction**: Avoid damage to expensive hardware
- **Training data**: Generate synthetic data for AI training

## Focus: Physics Simulation and Environment Building

This module covers:
- **Gazebo**: Physics simulation environment
- **Unity**: High-fidelity rendering and visualization
- **Sensor Simulation**: LiDAR, cameras, IMUs
- **Environment Building**: Creating realistic virtual worlds

## Why Simulation Matters

Simulation is essential for Physical AI because:
1. **Safety**: Test dangerous scenarios without risk
2. **Speed**: Run simulations faster than real-time
3. **Reproducibility**: Repeat experiments exactly
4. **Scalability**: Test with multiple robots simultaneously
5. **Cost**: Avoid hardware wear and damage

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
2. Create and import robot models using URDF/SDF
3. Simulate physics, gravity, and collisions
4. Use Unity for high-fidelity visualization
5. Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
6. Build complex environments for robot testing
