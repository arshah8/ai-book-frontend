# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## The Convergence of LLMs and Robotics

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) represents the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Robotics. This enables:
- **Natural Language Commands**: Control robots with spoken language
- **High-Level Planning**: LLMs translate commands to actions
- **Multimodal Understanding**: Combine vision and language
- **Generalization**: Handle diverse tasks with single model

## Focus Areas

1. **Voice-to-Action**: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
2. **Cognitive Planning**: LLMs translate natural language to ROS actions
3. **Multimodal Integration**: Combining vision, language, and action

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Integrate OpenAI Whisper for voice recognition
2. Use LLMs to translate commands to robot actions
3. Implement multimodal robot control
4. Build conversational robotics interfaces
5. Deploy VLA systems on edge devices
