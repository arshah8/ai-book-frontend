# Introduction

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** - a comprehensive course that bridges the gap between the digital brain and the physical body.

## Course Focus and Theme

**AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.**

This course focuses on applying AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## Course Goal

**Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body.**

Students will learn to:
- Design and control humanoid robots
- Simulate robot behaviors in realistic environments
- Integrate AI models with physical systems
- Deploy robots that understand and interact with the physical world

## Quarter Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## What You'll Learn

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Middleware for robot control
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Physics simulation and environment building
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Advanced perception and training
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - The convergence of LLMs and Robotics
- **Capstone**: The Autonomous Humanoid - A complete project integrating all concepts

## Prerequisites

This course is technically demanding and sits at the intersection of:
- Physics Simulation (Isaac Sim/Gazebo)
- Visual Perception (SLAM/Computer Vision)
- Generative AI (LLMs/VLA)

Basic knowledge of Python, Linux, and AI/ML concepts is recommended.
