# Course Overview

## Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Focus and Theme**: AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.

**Goal**: Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

## Quarter Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.
